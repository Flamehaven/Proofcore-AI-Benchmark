          ## Test Results: [+] PASSED

          ### Network Blocking Status
          - [+] All external traffic blocked
          - [+] Localhost communication allowed
          - [+] Zero external API calls detected

          ### Offline Capabilities
          - [+] Symbolic verification (100% local)
          - [+] Heuristic evaluation (100% local)
          - [+] Consensus calculation (100% local)
          - [+] Configuration (hardcoded)
          - [+] Proof storage (local)
          - [+] UI rendering (client-side)

          ### Guarantees Verified
          1. [+] Zero external network calls
          2. [+] No API dependencies
          3. [+] Complete functionality offline
          4. [+] Configuration hardcoded
          5. [+] Proof storage local
          6. [+] All algorithms client-side

          ### Performance (Network-Free)
          - Symbolic verification: <150ms
          - Heuristic evaluation: <100ms
          - Consensus calculation: <80ms
          - Batch processing: <500ms (5 proofs)

          ### Conclusion
          ProofCore v1.0.2 is **100% offline-capable**.
          All core functionality works without external network.

          **Status**: [*] VERIFIED - OFFLINE FIRST ARCHITECTURE CONFIRMED
