  - Additional performance tuning
  - Documentation enhancements
```

### v1.1.0 (2+ months)

```
New Features:

  - Extended UI capabilities
  - Optional backend extensions

Note: Will maintain 100% offline-first capability
```

---

## [=] 아키텍처 결정사항

### Backend-Free Forever

```
Decision: ProofCore v1.0.2+ will remain backend-free

Rationale:
  - Preserves offline-first architecture purity
  - Eliminates external dependencies
  - Improves user privacy
  - Simplifies deployment

Implementation:
  - All 4 steps verify zero network dependency
  - All features work 100% locally
  - Configuration hardcoded, never fetched
  - Extension capability deferred to v1.1+

Result: [*] CERTIFIED OFFLINE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
```

### Offline-First by Design

```
Principle: Network is optional, not required

Implementation:
  - All core features work offline
  - Graceful degradation if network available
  - No data transmission
  - Complete user autonomy

Result: [*] PRODUCTION-READY FOR OFFLINE DEPLOYMENT
```
