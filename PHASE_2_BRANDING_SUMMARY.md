  - Staging URL: staging.proofbench.your-domain.com → staging.proofcore.io
  - Production URL: proofbench.your-domain.com → proofcore.io

- [x] .github/workflows/docker-publish.yml
  - No ProofCore-specific content (generic Docker build)

- [x] .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - No ProofCore-specific content (generic CI)

- [x] .github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml
  - No ProofCore-specific content (generic Python publish)

- [x] .github/workflows/release.yml
  - No ProofCore-specific content (generic release)

### 2.5 Code Documentation & Comments

**Locations Updated**:
- [x] package.json: Added description
- [x] pyproject.toml: Updated all metadata
- [x] README.md: Complete rewrite
- [x] CLI commands: proofbench → proofcore
- [x] GitHub Actions: Pipeline names updated

**Note**: Individual source file comments will be left as-is (proofbench_engine.ts, etc.)
to preserve code lineage. Comments reference the architecture, not the brand.

### 2.6 Branding Verification Checklist

## Next Steps (Phase 2 → Phase 3)

### Before Starting Phase 3

- [ ] Commit Phase 2 branding changes to git
- [ ] Update migration state checkpoint to PHASE_2_COMPLETE
- [ ] Create git tag: v1.0.0-rc1-branding

### Phase 3: Architecture Cleanup (12 hours)

**Focus**: Resolve critical issues from Phase 1

**Key Tasks**:
1. Make LLM APIs truly optional (BLOCKING)
