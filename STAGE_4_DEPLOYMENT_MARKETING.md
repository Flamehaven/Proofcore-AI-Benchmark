Title: ProofCore â€“ Offline-First Mathematical Proof Verification (SIDRCE Tier 5)

Text:
We just released ProofCore v1.0.0 â€“ a hybrid mathematical proof verification
system that works 100% offline without any external APIs.

Backstory: After Frieder & Hart (2025) showed no LLM solved Yu Tsumura's 554th
problem, we built a system combining:
- 70% Symbolic verification (SymPy/Pyodide in WASM)
- 30% Semantic evaluation (multi-LLM consensus or heuristic offline)
- Graph analysis (cycle detection, critical paths)

Key stats:
- 281 passing tests (100% success)
- <300ms verification (p95)
- 100% offline operation
- SIDRCE Drift-Free Tier 5 certified
- Zero external dependencies in core path
- MIT licensed, open source
